# Comp-Graphic-and-Visualization
computational graphics and visualization
In this courseâ€™s project I was tasked with the role of C++ and OpenGL 3D graphics developer. The company I worked for was Triangle and Cube Studios, they design customized 3D worlds for clients. In this project the client wants to replicate a 3D version of a 2D image. This 3D version will later be used for a 3D printed concept. Therefore, the company only needs a basic visual of the image using simple shapes.
